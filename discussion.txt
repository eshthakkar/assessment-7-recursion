Recursion:

1. Recursion means calling the same function from within itself. It makes use of the call stack. Any loop can be written using recursion and vice versa.

2. Base case helps identify when we need to stop recursion. If we don't have it, we could go on recursing infinitely.

Graphs:

1. Graphs are like trees, except they can contain loops ("cycles").
Also, the relationships can be directed or non-directed.

2. In a graph, a node can have multiple parents, unlike a tree.
Graphs can contain cycles, unlike a tree.
Graphs do not have any hierarchy, whereas trees do. 
The edges can have weightage in a graph, there is no such thing in trees.
All trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees.

3. To visualize money transactions and flow of money within a network, we can use graphs.
State machines in chip designing are graphs.
They are used to model how a particular feature would behave, go from one state to another if certain conditions are met. As the link below shows:
